# Got To DO
A to-do app service.
The flow is as follows:

- Routes handle requests for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting to-do items.
- Authentication via JWT is required to access these routes(except the create).
- Operations on the to-do items are performed in the database, interacting with the specified fields.
